playx - Search and play any song that comes to your mind. If you have any issues, raise an issue in the github (https://github.com/NISH1001/playx) page

positional arguments:
  song                  Name or youtube link of song to download

                        Play based on terms provided
  -p, --play-cache      Play all songs from the cache. The cache is located at [~/.playx/songs/] by default

### Example
**Play by song name**
```bash
playx <song name>
```
  
**Play by youtube link**  
```bash
playx <YT url>
```

**Play by soundcloud links**
```sh
playx https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/232673157
```
This plays soundcloud [track](https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/232673157)
  
**Play from youtube playlist**  
```bash
playx <YT playlist URL>
```

**Play from a Billboard Chart**
```sh
playx hot-100
```

**Play from spotify playlist**
```sh
playx https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX5Ozry5U6G0d
```
This plays the songs from Spotify [Summer Party](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX5Ozry5U6G0d) playlist.

**Play from soundcloud playlist**
```sh
playx https://soundcloud.com/devintracy/sets/goodafternoon
```
This plays the songs from SoundCloud [playlist](https://soundcloud.com/devintracy/sets/goodafternoon)

**Play from JioSaavn playlist**
```sh
playx https://www.jiosaavn.com/featured/magical-amit-trivedi/IGYxX3V4T7w_
```
This plays songs from the JioSaavn [playlist](https://www.jiosaavn.com/featured/magical-amit-trivedi/IGYxX3V4T7w_)

**Play from YouTube Music Playlist**
```sh
playx <YT Music playlist url>
```

**Play from local playlist**

The local playlist should have an extension ```.playx``` in order for us to recognize it as a playlist.
```sh
playx example.playx
```
This plays a playlist named example.playx

For a playlist every line is considered an entry. Refer to [example.playx](https://github.com/NISH1001/playx/blob/develop/example.playx).  
  
**Auto-Generate Playlist**
```bash
playx --auto
```
This will automatically generate a playlist by using the frequency of songs played that has been logged in the log file.  


**Term-Based Search**
```bash
playx --rsearch <search terms>
```
This will automatically generate a playlist of cached songs containing the provided terms.
  
------------

## Cache Directory Structure
By default, `playx` creates a directory in the home as `~/.playx` (which is a hidden folder). 
Structure is like:  
```bash
.playx
    |- songs/
    |- logs/
    |- playlist/
    |- playxlist/
```

*songs*: This stores all the songs
*logs*: This stores the log for user activities of songs that are searched and played with creation date. This will be used for recommendation of songs in future version
*playlist*: This stores all the cached playlists files.
*playxlist*: Stores all the playxlist files.

------------

## Having Issues? (We're not perfect!)

### First update youtube-dl
[youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) is the core through which we fetch stream urls for any song or any YT playlist.  
So, update it first

```bash
pip install -U youtube-dl
```

youtube-dl keeps on rolling out updates actively because the YouTube keeps on updating its internals for html. So, the parser/crawler should be updated periodically.

### Second try cleaning the broken cache as
```bash
playx --clean
```
Chances are you have a url in the `urls.json` but the local mp3 might not exist in `~/.playx/songs/`.
So, cleaning and running the playx might mitigate that.

### See The Partial Log 
Log is found at `logs/partial_log`

### See Playlist File
Files can be found inside `playlist/`. Chances are there might be empty links or names.

### Selenium Web Driver Issue
Maybe you don't have the chromedriver that's required to crawl.  
One example of how we use chromedriver is [here](https://github.com/NISH1001/playx/blob/develop/playx/playlist/ytrelated.py#L126).

Not having proper setup of the driver may result in empty playlists, especially related playlist one.

## TO-DO
- ~~caching of downloaded songs (if the song exists locally, play it right away else play from youtube)~~
- ~~speed up the whole **search->download->convert->play** process~~
- ~~stream/play while downloading the song~~
- ~~play all the songs from the cache~~
- ~~search lyrics~~
- ~~play from youtube playlist~~
- ~~play from local playlist (may be a list of song names)~~
- ~~play from other playlist (spotify, billboard, etc.)~~
- ~~log activity~~
- ~~auto generate playlist~~
- ~~use Markov Chains to improve auto-playlist~~
- ~~local search based on term matching~~
- use Factorization Machines to improve auto-playlist
- use logs to create simple recommendations
- Add 3rd-party integration like Spotify (using authentication mechanism). [Priority - Low]
